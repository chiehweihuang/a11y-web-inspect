## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Six FP-class fixes from hunt round 2** (`beacon-static-audit@17` → `@18`, source:
  `beacon-benchmark-100/hunt-round-2/verdicts.json`): (1) `isHiddenAttrs` read the word
  "hidden" inside a quoted attribute VALUE (`style="overflow: hidden overlay;"`,
  `class="hidden md:block"`) as the boolean `hidden` ATTRIBUTE, opening a phantom hidden
  range that blacked out the rest of the document — now parses the tag with the existing
  quote-aware `attr-scan.mjs` instead of a bare regex over the raw attrs blob. (2) The
  `quality-flags` loop (generic alt / link text / role-echo) was the only detector loop
  in the file not gated on `visible()`, so it reported signals inside hidden subtrees.
  (3) Link accessible-name replaced HTML character references with a space before
  trimming, so an entity-only label (`&gt;&gt;` pagination arrows, `&raquo;`, `&hellip;`)
  collapsed to `''` and read as nameless — a new `decodeCommonEntities` decodes named +
  numeric references to their real characters instead. (4) Static contrast applied
  WCAG 1.4.3's 4.5:1 to every resolvable text node unconditionally; a node whose entire
  content is a Private-Use-Area codepoint (an icon-font glyph) is non-text and is now
  judged at 1.4.11's 3:1 instead, under a new `non-text-contrast-sub-threshold` key.
  (5) `input-label-missing` now implements the full HTML-AAM accessible-name fallback
  chain (aria-labelledby-resolving → aria-label → label[for]/wrapping label → title →
  placeholder); a bare `id` no longer exempts an input by itself, it must have a
  matching `<label for>` (fixing both the false positive AND its false-negative twin,
  three independent agents converged on this one); title/placeholder-only names emit a
  new `input-label-weak` review finding instead of a critical fail; 3.3.2 is now
  correctly labelled Level A. (6) `motion-reduced-motion-missing` is demoted to
  `check:'review'`, tagged `level:'AAA'`, and excluded from `legal_risk.mapped_criteria`
  and all six jurisdiction arrays (2.3.3 is Level AAA, never a legal baseline in any
  mapped jurisdiction) — motion returns to `not-machine-checkable` whenever it has any
  evidence, fires or handled, and never scores again. Its trigger was rewritten from a
  file-wide `/(animation|transition):/` presence check to require a motion-bearing
  property (transform, a position offset, or a `@keyframes` animation using one — never
  color/background/border-color/box-shadow/opacity, and `transition: all` counts too)
  on a selector verified reachable in the static markup; hover/active-gated
  micro-transitions are noted as weaker evidence in the finding description rather than
  suppressed, and an unfetchable external stylesheet is called out as a capture gap
  rather than a confirmed absence.
- **hakuso round-1 follow-up on item 6**: the `animation` shorthand is
  order-independent (`animation: 1s spin` and `animation: 1s ease-in spin` both name the
  keyframe "spin"), but only the first token was checked — fixed to test every token.

### Measured

- **Wild-corpus movement, `test/wild-corpus/` (40 real captured pages)**: 31/40 sites
  moved end to end (`@17` → `@18`), verified against the committed `@17` engine run side
  by side, not inferred. The five non-motion fixes moved 19/40
  (`benchmark/2026-08-10-at18-fpclass-movement.md`); the motion demote + rewrite moved a
  further 30/40 on top of that (`benchmark/2026-08-10-at18-item6-motion-movement.md`,
  includes the hakuso animation-token-scan fix, +1/40 more with no score change since
  motion was already out of scoring by then). No finding key was lost or gained outside
  the two new keys (`non-text-contrast-sub-threshold`, `input-label-weak`); every other
  key change is a count movement of an existing key. Golden vectors:
  `clean.expected.json` coverage 66%→61% (motion `scored`/100→`not-machine-checkable` —
  it leaves the scored set, which is why coverage drops; confidence stays `medium`,
  overall score unaffected); `dirty.expected.json` coverage/confidence/
  score unchanged (61%/`medium`/9) — the fixture gained a second, genuinely nameless
  `<input>` so `input-label-missing` stays exercised alongside the new
  `input-label-weak` case. No fresh Spearman/GT rerun for `@18` — findings outside the
  six fixes are unaffected, same not-yet-empirically-reverified status as `@17`.

## [3.3.1] — 2026-08-08

### Measured

- **Per-detector precision, on pages nobody hand-picked.** VALIDATION.md L1 has always
  required a wild-sample false-positive measurement before a detector may feed the score;
  most detectors never had one. Six now do, sampled across distinct real sites, judged
  instance by instance at the cited markup and adversarially re-judged: `image-alt` 1.000,
  `link-name` 0.933, `heading-order` 0.867, `clickable` 0.615, `button-name` 0.600,
  `input-label` 0.417 (n=15 each; confidence intervals and every per-instance call,
  including the eight the reviewer overturned, in `benchmark/2026-08-03-wild-precision/`).
  The leading cause of false positives is markup hidden by a stylesheet class rather than
  an inline style — the first price tag on the Tier-2 capture-annotation gap.

### Added

- **Wild regression corpus** (`test/wild-corpus/`): 40 real captured pages with per-site
  score and per-key finding counts frozen, re-audited by `node --test`. Catches page-wide
  regressions that hand-written fixtures structurally cannot show; the 2026-07
  phantom-mask class would have failed here immediately.

### Fixed

- **L2 monotonicity KNOWN VIOLATION** (`beacon-static-audit@16` → `@17`, user ruling
  2026-08-08, "A+"): retired the `insufficient-evidence` category state, which could exit a
  thin (1-2 check) category from the weighted average and let fixing a violation LOWER the
  overall score. Any auditable evidence now scores; a category below `THIN_EVIDENCE_MIN` (3)
  instead carries a `thin: true` flag, rendered in the report as a same-line, same-weight
  qualifier next to the score (never colour-alone) rather than an unscored, hidden state.
  The 90-100 band's conclusion wording also downgrades when overall coverage is under 50%
  (ruling #3), so a high score built on a sliver of measured weight no longer reads as an
  unqualified "meets baseline". 38/40 sites moved on the 40-site wild regression corpus
  (median |Δ| 7, max |Δ| 58 — cuni.cz, `0 → 58`, the case that motivated the fix); finding
  keys unchanged on all 40 sites (scoring-only change, `benchmark/2026-08-08-aplus-movement.md`).
  No fresh Spearman/GT rerun for `@17` — findings are unaffected by this change, so both are
  expected unchanged from `@12`, not yet empirically re-verified.
- **Three detector false-positive classes** found by that measurement
  (`beacon-static-audit@15`): out-of-scope input types (`submit`/`hidden`/`button`/
  `image`/`reset`) no longer demand a label; `title` is accepted as a button's accessible
  name, as it already was for links; and an attribute *name* that merely contains the
  substring `onclick` is no longer read as a click handler. Re-running the same sample
  afterwards eliminates 7 of the 20 adjudicated false positives with no true positive
  lost — but that is a re-check on the very instances the fixes were written against, not
  independent evidence, so the published precision figures stay at their measured values
  until a fresh holdout sample is drawn and judged.
- The `title` fix went through three adversarial review rounds and needed all of them: the
  first version matched any attribute *ending* in `title`, so `data-title` — and worse, an
  empty `title=""` — silently suppressed genuinely nameless buttons. That is the third
  appearance of one bug class (an attribute matched by substring rather than by name);
  a shared attribute-reading primitive that makes the class unrepresentable is queued.
- Known recall cost, recorded rather than hidden: the `onclick` anchoring also stops the
  detector from accidentally catching framework click bindings (`data-wp-on--click` and
  friends) that it had only ever matched by coincidence, through a string inside an
  attribute *value*. Those elements are real violations; detecting them deliberately is
  queued.
- **Three previously-unmeasured detectors were badly broken** (`beacon-static-audit@16`):
  completing the wild-sample precision table above surfaced `html-lang-mismatch` (precision
  0.067 — its Vietnamese character class included ordinary Portuguese diacritics, misflagging
  every á/ã page), `focus-outline-removed` (0.267 — narrowed to unscoped resets after missing
  four real violations, including `* { outline: none }`), and `fixed-minmax-overflow`
  (0.133 — has no model of CSS grid, so demoted to `check:'review'` rather than narrowed to
  fit two examples). `list-non-li-child` also lost a true positive to a backreference bug and
  was rewritten to a non-consuming, depth-counted scan. A shared attribute-tokenization
  primitive (`core/scripts/attr-scan.mjs`) now backs four detectors that had each
  independently mismatched attributes by substring.
- **Masking unified into one scanner, plus a wrapper false-positive class**
  (`beacon-static-audit@13`/`@14`): script/style/noscript/comment ranges were three
  independent regex passes that could pair across each other and open a phantom mask
  swallowing every later finding on the page (latent since `@5`); now one left-to-right
  scan. A div/span whose own direct content wraps a native `<button>`/`<a href>` (an
  analytics wrapper) no longer reads as a keyboard barrier.
- **`--output` to a nonexistent directory no longer crashes**: `static-audit.mjs`,
  `generate-report.mjs`, `tier2-audit.mjs`, and `lighthouse-extract.mjs` now create the
  parent directory before writing, matching the documented
  `--output reports/a11y/audit-results.json` usage on a project's first run.

### Documentation

- Published the per-detector precision table above and Beacon's own measured WCAG 2.2
  A+AA coverage (14/55 criteria have any detector, 2/55 fully decided) across every
  README, translation, and the landing site, replacing the inherited "~30-40%" industry
  estimate.
- Named who each of the 53 undecided WCAG criteria leaves out, per that criterion's own
  W3C-documented beneficiary population, correcting 12 previously wrong or imprecise rows.
- De-Claude'd the Codex-adapter skill and reference docs (a marker-block system so
  `build.mjs` emits divergent prose per adapter from one source) and fixed a Codex
  plugin-manifest validation gap (missing `capabilities`/`defaultPrompt` fields).

## [3.3.0] — 2026-07-27

Native Tier-2 browser measurement harness (`beacon-tier2-audit@2`) + a static contrast
reference value (`beacon-static-audit@10`) + axe-core optionalization with a code-backed
contrast gate (`beacon-static-audit@11`) + two detector bugs found and fixed while
self-measuring WCAG coverage (`beacon-static-audit@12`) + Codex distribution moving to
a native plugin marketplace.

- **Native Tier-2 harness** (`core/scripts/tier2-audit.mjs`): a plain-Playwright browser
  layer (no axe-core dependency) that measures WCAG 2.2 1.4.3 contrast and 2.5.8
  touch-target size at 320px and 1280px viewports. Capture/analyze split mirrors
  `focus-flow.mjs`: DOM/computed-style walking stays browser-side, all color math
  (parsing, multi-layer alpha compositing, luminance, ratio) is pure and unit-tested.
  **Findings-only by default, not score-inert**: the harness emits a separate
  findings-only artifact with no automatic scoring — merging its findings with
  `--merge-findings` (the same path axe already uses) CAN move `overall_score`,
  `coverage_percent`, and the category's state, once the category's merged evidence
  reaches `THIN_EVIDENCE_MIN`. What is deferred is auto-merging in the default `inspect`
  flow, not the scoring mechanism itself. Touch-target spacing implements the real circle-vs-circle test for
  undersized neighbors (an earlier circle-vs-rect version under-detected the 12-24px gap
  band, fixed after a hakuso HIGH finding). Background resolution refuses to guess
  through a background-image/gradient ancestor, and fully-transparent foreground text is
  guarded (previously a false 1.00:1 fail). Repo stays dependency-free: the harness
  detects an available Playwright at runtime and fails loudly, with actionable next
  steps, when one isn't found; a new `tier2-browser` CI job installs Playwright +
  Chromium into a scratch dir to exercise it.
- **Tier-2 engine bump to `beacon-tier2-audit@2`** (2026-07-26 calibration pass,
  `plans/2026-07-26-tier2-bugfix-notes.md` + `plans/2026-07-26-tier2-calibration.md`): four
  real detector defects found by hand-adjudicating a wild-population run, not corpus
  artifacts. (1) Non-ancestor backgrounds (Wix "Get Started"/"Thriving with Wix" sibling
  overlay, Atlassian `#tab-teamwork` pill, linear.app's two hero-text spans relying on a
  `color-scheme: dark` default canvas) now mark the sample `tier2-contrast-unresolvable`
  instead of a guessed pass/fail — background resolution also now catches pseudo-element
  and inset-box-shadow paint, not just background-image/gradient. (2) Disabled/
  `aria-disabled` controls (confirmed on a Mailchimp survey-modal button and an
  en.wikipedia.org donation banner) are excluded from contrast sampling entirely, per WCAG
  1.4.3's inactive-component exemption. (3) A `SETTLE_QUIET_MS = 500` settle window
  (measured on a wayfair.com PerimeterX snapshot: 1 unstable finding at 0ms, 5 stable
  findings from 300ms on) makes repeated runs on the same page byte-identical. (4) A
  per-viewport try/catch (confirmed on a real zoom.us snapshot's navigation race) records
  `{viewport, error}` and continues to the next viewport instead of killing the whole
  process.
- **Tier-2 report rendering** (`core/scripts/generate-report.mjs`): the score/category
  card gains a provenance chip + measured-value line for any category tier-2 findings
  touched — a bilingual "Browser-measured (tier 2)" chip with the measured denominator
  (samples/targets actually looked at, from `audit.tier2.summary.by_viewport`), and a
  per-finding-group line rendering the actual measured ratio/color pair (contrast) or
  width/height (touch), including the 24px spacing-exception note when that's why a touch
  target failed. Four new bilingual `FINDING_I18N` keys (`tier2-contrast-fail`,
  `tier2-contrast-unresolvable`, `tier2-touch-target-fail`, `tier2-touch-target-advisory`);
  N unresolvable instances at the same key collapse into one finding group with an
  aggregate `×N` count rather than one row per instance. Purely presentational: category
  `state`/`score` are computed exactly as before this change and are never touched by it.
- **Static contrast reference value** (`static-audit.mjs`'s contrast category): an
  evidence line plus per-pair `check:'review'` findings for foreground/background pairs
  that are certain from the source file alone (inline styles, or a same-file `<style>`
  rule matched by a whole bare class/id selector — any doubt, including an
  externally-defined class or `alpha < 1`, leaves the pair unresolved rather than
  guessed). Every finding is review-severity, so this is **zero score effect** —
  verified on real snapshots and both golden vectors. Calibrated in three rounds against
  hand adjudication of the raw source, the third broadening the population to 774
  snapshots / 78 sites with resolvable pairs (`plans/2026-07-26-contrast-calibration-broad.md`)
  and catching a new false-positive shape: an absolutely-positioned overlay whose real
  visual backdrop is a photographic `<img>` sibling, not a CSS background, was resolved
  against a distant, unrelated ancestor's background instead (confirmed on
  100291.html:2790, a 1.00:1 white-on-white false "finding"). Fixed the same way as the
  existing background-image block: an `<img>` sibling behind a `position:absolute`/`fixed`
  element now blocks the walk instead of guessing.
- **Axe-core optionalization + code-backed contrast gate**: `inspect.md` now documents
  `scripts/tier2-audit.mjs` as the default browser layer; axe-core moves from a required
  baseline to an optional cross-check for ARIA-validity rules tier-2 doesn't cover yet.
  The contrast-verification gate the doc always mandated was found doc-promised but not
  code-backed — `static-audit.mjs` hardcoded `requires_live_audit: true` and never
  emitted the mandated tip. Fixed at the root: the engine now checks, once after any
  merge, whether real browser-verified contrast data was merged in, and emits a
  bilingual, review-severity `contrast-not-verified` tip (or flips
  `requires_live_audit`) accordingly. Golden vectors regenerated for the new tip; both
  gained exactly one finding, scores unchanged.
- **What did not change**: scoring semantics are untouched by this release — every
  finding NATIVELY added by `@10`/`@11` (the static engine's own detectors) is
  `check:'review'`, which never enters the fail/severity accounting on its own. The two
  Tier-2 categories (contrast, touch) are ordinary weighted categories already in
  `CATEGORY_WEIGHTS` — merging tier-2 findings with `--merge-findings` moves their score
  exactly like any other merged finding, once merged evidence reaches
  `THIN_EVIDENCE_MIN`; nothing about this release adds a new, permanently-unscored
  category. Ground-truth P/R (`1.000 / 0.727 / 0.829`, pattern/instance) carries unchanged
  from `@8`: neither GT criterion set nor FP adjudication touches `check:'review'`
  findings. No benchmark Spearman rerun was performed for `@10`/`@11` — expected
  score-neutral for the static engine's own findings per the argument above, not yet
  empirically confirmed on the full cohort.
- **Engine bump to `beacon-static-audit@12`** (hakuso audit of a WCAG coverage-measurement
  document found these with fixtures, `plans/2026-07-27-wcag-coverage-measurement.md`):
  two `document-title-missing`/`html-lang-missing` false-negative bugs, fixed at the root.
  `document-title-missing`'s check matched a `<title>` anywhere in the raw text (including
  inside an `<svg><title>` icon label) and accepted whitespace-only content; it now strips
  inline `<svg>` (a different, SVG-namespaced element) and requires non-empty trimmed text
  on the first remaining `<title>`, matching `document.title` semantics — a first attempt
  additionally scoped the search to before `</head>`/`<body>`, which a hakuso auditor caught
  in real Chromium as over-flagging real titled pages (a `<title>` in the body or a hidden
  ancestor still sets `document.title`); dropped, keeping only the svg-strip and the trim.
  `html-lang-missing`'s presence test matched the `xml:lang=` substring (no real `lang`
  attribute needed); it now requires the whitespace that separates a real HTML attribute. A
  new `html-lang-invalid` finding (bilingual `FINDING_I18N` entry) catches a malformed tag
  shape (e.g. `lang="english"`) via a new `isWellFormedLangTag()` BCP-47-shape check in
  `lang-detect.mjs`, which previously fell through `assessLang` to `UNMODELLED` (silently
  unflagged) — a shape-valid-but-wrong code like `lang="jp"` is unaffected, still caught by
  `assessLang`'s existing country-code path. Golden vectors: fingerprint-only diff (neither
  fixture exercises these cases). GT retention re-verified directly: zero finding-set diff
  on all 20 `benchmark/2026-07-06-ground-truth/` sites and on the broader 86-site
  `benchmark/2026-07-05/` population (ADDED 0 / REMOVED 0, final version). Full detail,
  including the head/body-scoping false positive found and fixed mid-pass: VALIDATION.md's
  `@12` engine section.
- **Self-measured WCAG 2.2 A+AA coverage table** (`plans/2026-07-27-wcag-coverage-measurement.md`):
  replaces inherited industry-hearsay coverage percentages with a criterion-by-criterion
  table verified against the current detector code, not the doc's prior claims. After
  resolving three inconsistently-applied machine-testability rows and shipping the `@12`
  fixes above: **14/55 criteria (25.5%) have any coverage, 2/55 (3.6%) are fully decided**
  by the engine alone; against the narrower machine-testable-in-principle subset (48
  criteria) that is **14/48 (29.2%) any coverage, 2/48 (4.2%) fully decided**. 2.4.2 Page
  Titled and 3.1.1 Language of Page are the only two FULL rows, and only because of the
  `@12` fixes above — both were previously miscounted as FULL by a doc claim the code
  didn't back. Full row-by-row detail and the machine-testability rule: the plan doc;
  numbers cross-checked against VALIDATION.md's `@12` section.
- **Codex distribution moves to a native plugin marketplace**: replaces the hand-copy
  deploy script (`tools/deploy-codex.mjs`, removed) with Codex's own marketplace mechanism
  — `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` plus a generated
  `adapters/codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` whose version is driven by
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` through `build.mjs`, with a `build.mjs --check` guard and a
  `.release.json` sync entry so the manifest can never ship a version behind. Install is
  now:
  ```bash
  codex plugin marketplace add chiehweihuang/beacon
  codex plugin add beacon@beacon
  ```

## [3.2.0] — 2026-07-24

Engine `beacon-static-audit@9` (thin-evidence category state) + report information
architecture redesign (Workstream B) + a review round on the new report (score
scope-binding, standard lines, evidence clamp, life-safety banner) + new governance
gates (layout integrity, font floor, horizontal-scroll ban), all in the same release.

- **New category state `insufficient-evidence`**: a category that would otherwise be
  `scored` but has fewer than 3 total machine checks (`pass + fail < 3`) now reports
  `score: null` and exits the scoring denominator (weight redistributed, same mechanism
  as `not-machine-checkable`/`not-applicable`). A 1-2 check category is a coin-flip
  denominator — indistinguishable in confidence from a six-check 100 if rendered as a
  number. Findings are unaffected: the category's fail(s) are still listed in full;
  `coverage_percent` drops to carry the honesty signal instead. The N=3 threshold is a
  **calibration decision** (VALIDATION.md L2), not a physical constant — revisit with data.
- Report renderer: the new state gets its own text badge and detail line (bilingual,
  zh/en), rendered the same way as the other unscored states; unscored categories never
  render a score ring (pre-existing behavior, confirmed unaffected).
- **Golden vectors regenerated**: `clean.expected.json` keeps `overall_score: 100` (top
  band still reachable) but `keyboard`/`forms`/`responsive`/`motion` move from `scored`
  to `insufficient-evidence` (each had exactly 1 native check); coverage 66% → 23%,
  confidence `medium` → `low`. `dirty.expected.json`: `keyboard`/`forms`/`responsive`
  move the same way (1-2 checks each); `overall_score` 9 → 0 (the dirty fixture's one
  above-average category, responsive at 45, was carried by exactly 2 checks and exits
  the denominator). Every changed line is explained by the N=3 threshold; no other diff.
- **Benchmark rerun** (`beacon-benchmark-100/run-2026-07-05`, n=71 paired vs Lighthouse):
  Spearman 0.477 (@8) → **0.468** (@9) — a small decrease; the rank correlation absorbs
  score movements unevenly across the cohort even though most individual deltas are
  improvements. Score-delta distribution across 85 comparable sites: median |Δ| = 7,
  p95 = 19, max = 23 (wayfair.com −23; squarespace.com +21); 18 band flips. Motivating
  case confirmed: rakuten.co.jp 40 → **54** (`responsive` and `motion` each had exactly
  1 fail with 0 counterbalancing pass — a naked 0 on a coin-flip denominator — and both
  now exit the denominator instead of dragging the weighted average down).
- **GT retention** (finding emission is unaffected by this change — `scoreCategory` never
  touches the findings array): `total_findings` counts are byte-identical between the
  archived @8 results and the @9 rerun across all 85 comparable benchmark sites,
  including all 7 sites in the `gt-remap-6` ground-truth cohort. Ground-truth P/R
  (1.000 / 0.727, `pr-analysis-v8.json`) stands unchanged — no FP introduced, no TP lost.
- **Evidence excerpt clamping**: `code_before`/`code_after`/evidence excerpts are now
  capped to a ~300-char window centered on the matched text (ellipsis on cut ends, match
  kept intact) at the shared `snippetAt` capture path — a single-line minified CSS block
  no longer produces a 15KB `code_before` (found on rakuten.co.jp's `focus-outline-removed`
  finding, benchmark `run-2026-07-05`). Report generator adds a defense-in-depth ~500-char
  hard cap with a bilingual truncation notice so a stale oversized audit JSON can never
  blow up the rendered report. Evidence strings never entered scoring; no golden delta is
  score-affecting.

### Workstream B — report information architecture redesign

- Replaced the tabbed table/expand-detail report layout with a single scrolling read:
  a decision hero (overall score, coverage/confidence derivation, life-safety-or-safe
  flag, and a "fix these next" panel ranking the top 3 remediation actions by
  severity × instance count), evidence-density category cards (a log-scaled meter
  showing how many checks stand behind each score or unscored state), findings grouped
  by fix action rather than repeated per instance (with per-category filter chips), and
  an always-visible, print-ready client executive summary. Methodology, jurisdiction
  mapping, and optional Lighthouse performance signals remain as a deep-dive tail
  (sections 05-07) behind the same jump nav.
- Everything renders from the audit artifact at generation time — no mockup-era numbers
  hardcoded into the generator.
- Carries forward the existing zh/en language toggle and light/dark/auto theme toolbar
  (localStorage-persisted), plus the Layout Integrity Gate and sans-serif font-floor
  rules (explicit CJK-safe stacks on every `font-family`, including `pre`/`code`, so
  CJK text never falls back to a legacy Ming/Mincho face).
- **Review round on the new hero**: the score ring caption now reads "N/100・機測部分"
  with a coverage-only line, scoping the number to what was actually machine-measured;
  the confidence-low sentence is removed from the rendered report (still recorded in
  the audit JSON's `confidence_level`). A bilingual "標準・Standard" line — what the
  cited WCAG criterion actually requires — now precedes every fix line across all 27
  finding keys, grounded in `core/references/wcag-quick.md`; the two keys that had a
  detector but no rendered copy (`html-lang-mismatch`, `html-lang-mismatch-review`)
  gained their missing text in the same pass, covered by a new coverage test (330/330
  green). Manual/insufficient category cards gain a pointer sentence toward tier-2
  (browser/human) measurement. The life-safety banner, dropped when Workstream B
  rewrote the hero, is restored in the new layout.
- **New governance gates** (enforced in this guide, the advisor pattern table, the
  `bright-raven-uiux`/`akegarasu-design` skills, and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`): a Layout
  Integrity Gate (text-measure floor, content-driven height, full-width sweep at
  320-1920 plus a non-breakpoint width); a sans-serif font floor across zh/en/ja
  including code blocks, later narrowed to ban only PMingLiU/MingLiU (other serif
  faces remain a deliberate, reviewed choice); and a horizontal-scroll ban (nav/chips
  wrap, long strings and tables break-wrap or reflow instead of `overflow-x`, verified
  with a `scrollWidth <= clientWidth` assertion).

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-22

Engine @8 + the production improvement loop + public services entry points.

- Engine `beacon-static-audit@8` includes `role="heading" aria-level="1-6"` in the document outline and excludes native headings with `role="presentation|none"`. This addresses the remaining aria-heading attribution gap identified by the v3.0 ground-truth study.
- Measured (2026-07-22, study rerun): ground-truth precision 0.979 → **1.000**, pattern recall 0.712 → **0.727**, instance recall 0.826 → 0.829, FP patterns 1 → **0** — the engine now reports ibm.com's true 1→4 aria-heading skip instead of the spurious h1→h5, and jnto.go.jp's presentational-heading FP is gone (+3 points, the only benchmark score that moved; 47/47 prior TPs retained; Spearman 0.477, n=71, noise-level vs @7's 0.480). Known ceiling recorded in the GT README: the outline detector reports only the first level-skip per document.
- Refreshed the public roadmap, release highlights, Claude/Codex install parity, and skill/hook boundary language.
- Category summaries now say when the static scan completed but a score cannot be justified, provide per-category and expand-all disclosure controls, and render as in-viewport cards on mobile instead of requiring horizontal table scrolling.
- **Services pointer**: the HTML report gains a one-line footer linking to the landing page's new Services section (maintainer's accessibility consulting; disclosure included — scores are never influenced by contact). Landing pages and README carry the same section.
- **Production improvement loop**: `beacon:inspect` now keeps a local-only usage ledger (`~/.beacon/usage.jsonl` — inspect summaries + user false-positive marks; never transmitted, deletable anytime) and offers an opt-in upstream FP report: sanitized payload, shown in full before anything is shared, prefilled into the new `false-positive` GitHub issue form. Detector fixes triggered by reports still walk the full VALIDATION.md discipline.
- Bilingual landing page with live sample reports (GitHub Pages), demo-report back-navigation, and the plugin@marketplace format note next to the install command.
- Measurement infrastructure (local benchmark workspace, reference copies in benchmark/drift-harness/): self-maintaining target registry grown to 100 core sites (append-only policy, active floor, auto re-probe of walled sites), Tranco-sourced survey tier on the road to 10,000 sites, weekly capture-drift schedule, a queryable SQLite layer over all measurement data, and consented community-report ingestion.


All notable changes to Beacon are documented here. Versions follow the plugin
manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`); dates are release-prep dates.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-07

Scoring-semantics overhaul driven by the 2026-07-05 scoring-validity audit, hardened
over three validation rounds (engine `beacon-static-audit@3` → `@7`).
**Breaking: scores shift versus 2.3.0.**

### Changed

- **Category states**: a category with no machine evidence now reports
  `state: "not-machine-checkable"` (review-only) or `"not-applicable"` (no evidence) with
  `score: null`. The former placeholder scores (constant 60 for review-only categories,
  100 for empty ones) are gone — absence of evidence is no longer presented as a score.
- **Overall score** is the weighted average over scored categories only, weights
  renormalised; `summary.coverage_percent` reports the share of scoring weight actually
  measured. This removes the old hidden ceiling of 86 that made the 90+ band unreachable.
- **Report**: the category table column that rendered the score under a "Coverage" header
  is now labelled Score; real weight coverage appears under the hero rings; unscored
  categories render text state badges instead of score bars.
- **Gradient restoration**: named buttons, labelled inputs, alt-carrying images, named
  links, and keyboard-paired click handlers now count as passes, so keyboard and forms
  scores are proportions instead of binary {100, 0}.
- **Life-safety gate**: a confirmed critical on WCAG 2.3.1 caps the overall score at 49,
  sets `summary.life_safety_flag`, and renders a dedicated report banner — category
  weights can no longer dilute a seizure risk.
- **Merge ingestion**: `--merge-findings` accepts `check: "pass"` for externally verified
  passes (previously silently coerced to FAIL); unknown check values are skipped with a
  warning instead of becoming fails.
- **`confidence_level`** is derived from measured coverage (low / medium; the static
  pipeline never claims high) instead of being hardcoded to `medium`.
- **Score bands** are emitted in the artifact (`summary.score_bands`) as the single source
  for report colouring and docs; the stale 4-band interpretation table and the retired
  44-site narrative ranges were removed from inspect.md.

### Fixed (validated on the committed 87-site benchmark, `benchmark/2026-07-05/`)

Engine `beacon-static-audit@4`. Each false-positive class below was found by per-site
adversarial diagnosis of Beacon-vs-Lighthouse rank outliers, verified against the raw
markup, then fixed test-first. Re-running the identical snapshots moved Spearman rank
correlation with Lighthouse a11y from **0.354 to 0.474** (n=71 pairs).

- **Attribute-order sensitivity**: `viewport-meta-missing`, `meta-description-missing`,
  and `canonical-missing` fired whenever `content=` / `href=` / `data-rh=` preceded
  `name=` / `rel=` (React Helmet et al.). Four benchmark sites were falsely flagged; a
  single phantom viewport fail zeroed the whole responsive category.
- **`image-alt-missing`** now exempts images removed from the accessibility tree:
  `aria-hidden="true"`, `role="presentation|none"`, inline `display:none` (tracking
  pixels, preload stashes). One site carried 14 false criticals from this class alone.
- **Adjacent nameless buttons** no longer merge into one greedy regex match (the inner
  tag group swallowed `</button>`), so icon-button rows are counted per instance.
- **Severity stacking cap**: the per-category severity penalty counts at most 3 instances
  per finding key — 9 identical criticals stamped out by one reused nav template had
  floored a 96%-passing category to 0. All instances still count in the pass/fail base.
- **New detector `frame-title-missing`** (WCAG 4.1.2): statically detectable and
  previously a silent gap that let iframe-heavy pages score 100.

### Fixed (round 2 — validated on the 2026-07-06 ground-truth study, `benchmark/2026-07-06-ground-truth/`)

Engine `beacon-static-audit@5`. Driven by a 20-site evidence-anchored violation
inventory (10 structural criterion classes, triangulated + adversarially verified).
Against it: 14/15 unambiguous false-positive classes eliminated, 39/39 true positives
retained, 18 previously-missed violation patterns now caught. Benchmark Spearman vs
Lighthouse a11y: 0.474 → 0.488.

- **Hidden-subtree masking** (`computeHiddenRanges`): elements inside inline
  `display:none` / `visibility:hidden`, `aria-hidden="true"`, or `[hidden]` subtrees
  produce no findings AND no passes across all markup detectors (img, iframe, link,
  button, input, list, clickable, headings). The dominant ground-truth FP class —
  hidden tracking iframes, preload images, collapsed carousels/menus — dies here
  (rakuten.co.jp alone: 125 false image-alt criticals).
- **`document-title-missing`** no longer fires on `<title data-next-head="">…</title>`
  (attribute-bearing title tags; hit Next.js sites).
- **img/iframe detectors respect script masking**: template literals inside `<script>`
  bodies are not elements.
- **Button accessible-name computation descends**: a child carrying a non-empty
  `aria-label` (e.g. a labelled `<svg>`) names its button.
- **Link wrapped-image alt semantics**: a wrapped `<img alt="text">` names the link
  (pass); all-`alt=""` wrapped images leave the link nameless (now a caught violation —
  previously silently deferred); images with no alt stay deferred to image-alt.
- **Hidden headings excluded from the outline sequence** (a `display:none` h2 no longer
  bridges an h1→h3 skip).

### Added — validation charter (engine `beacon-static-audit@6`)

`VALIDATION.md` makes the whole validity discipline executable and model-agnostic
(written so any capable maintainer or LLM can run it without session context):

- **Golden test vectors** (`test/golden/` + `test/golden-vectors.test.mjs`): committed
  input → committed expected artifact; pins the reachable top (clean=100) and the fail
  band (dirty=9, 13 criticals). Regenerate intentionally via `test/golden/regen.mjs`.
- **Scoring property tests** (`test/scoring-properties.test.mjs`): monotonicity,
  injection dose-response (self-ground-truthed), and cross-stack fairness — which
  caught a real bug on first run: `data-reactid` contains the substring `id=` and
  suppressed unlabelled-input findings on React pages only. Fixed (`\sid=` anchoring),
  closing the documented data-id blind spot.
- **Cross-machine determinism**: engine sorts its file list and normalises path
  separators; new CI matrix (`.github/workflows/validation.yml`, 3 OS × 2 Node) fails
  on any platform-dependent artifact diff.
- **Drift comparator** (`tools/drift-compare.mjs`): score-delta distribution / band
  flips between two benchmark runs — the instrument for the temporal-baseline and
  two-machine experiments that will publish the score's error bar.
- Benchmark rank correlation unchanged vs @5 (Spearman 0.488).

### Fixed (round 3 — engine `beacon-static-audit@7`, driven by the CJK FP study `benchmark/2026-07-07-cjk-fp/`)

- **Wrapping-label recognition**: `input-label-missing` no longer flags inputs inside
  `<label>…</label>` and credits them as forms passes. This killed 46 of the
  detector's 57 findings across the 88-site benchmark (81% FP rate — the largest
  remaining wild FP class, concentrated on jnto.go.jp ×43 and spotify.com ×3).
- **Phantom-range masking (latent since @5)**: both range scanners
  (`computeHiddenRanges`, new `computeLabelRanges`) previously tokenized raw text, so
  a tag token inside a `<script>` template string or an HTML comment could open a
  phantom range and silently swallow every downstream finding on the page. Tag tokens
  inside script/style bodies and HTML comments are now invisible to the scanners, and
  commented-out markup no longer yields findings or passes for any markup detector.
  Known residual (documented in-code): `<!--` inside an attribute value still leaks;
  needs a real lexer; not hit by any known benchmark page.
- Gate: three-round adversarial review (two empirically-reproduced BLOCKs fixed, then
  PASS), 12 new adversarial regression tests (322 total), goldens unchanged except the
  engine fingerprint, semantic held-out gate green.
- Effect on the 88-site benchmark: only the two FP-carrying sites moved (jnto +20,
  spotify +8, one band flip fail→needs-work); all other 83 compared sites byte-stable.
  Spearman vs Lighthouse 0.488 → 0.480 (n=71; within the ±1-point capture-noise floor,
  and the fix is ground-truth-driven, not rank-driven). Ground-truth re-verify at @7:
  47/47 flagged violations retained, the single known FP (aria-heading) unchanged —
  the @6 P/R (0.979 / 0.712) carries to @7 on the ground-truth scope.

### Measured (2026-07-07 — validation results for engine @6)

- **Official ground-truth P/R after the detector fixes** (full @6 re-mapping of the
  20-site inventory; every residue finding adjudicated + adversarially re-verified):
  precision 0.600 → **0.979**, pattern recall 0.591 → **0.712**, instance recall
  0.743 → **0.826**; FP patterns 26 → **1** (the known aria-heading bridging gap on
  ibm.com). Lighthouse on the same inventory: 0.811 / 0.462 / 0.225. Zero new
  violations entered the pool, so the numbers are directly comparable to @4. See
  `benchmark/2026-07-06-ground-truth/README.md`.
- **Temporal score drift baseline** (2-day window, 13-site stratified subset, same
  machine, pinned capture recipe): median |Δ| 0, p95 |Δ| 1, max 1, zero band flips —
  the same-machine error bar is ±1 point (VALIDATION.md L0). Cross-machine bar still
  unmeasured.
- **rakuten link-name spot-check resolved**: the hidden-subtree walker is correct, not
  over-masking — all 83 eliminated candidates sit in genuine inline-hidden subtrees
  (72 cloned genre-tab carousel panels).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-26

Held-out-driven detector precision/recall improvements; each fix is validated by
the held-out case it targets, which then becomes a regression guard.

### Improved

- **aria-hidden-on-focusable** no longer flags an element already made inert with
  `tabindex="-1"` (the canonical remediation): precision 0.67 → 1.00.
- **3.3.8 authentication** strips HTML comments before scanning, so captcha markup
  quoted in a comment is not treated as a live barrier: precision 0.88 → 1.00.
- **3.1.1 language** now detects Latin-vs-Latin mismatches (English declared over
  French / German / Spanish / Vietnamese, etc.) via a function-word profile,
  closing the script-counting blind spot: recall 0.50 → 1.00, precision still 1.00.
- **prescriptive-input-copy / positive-tabindex** gain a dependency-free structural
  strip (HTML comments + `<code>`/`<pre>` blocks, plus a string-respecting JS
  comment lexer), so they stop firing on copy/attributes quoted in comments or
  example code while still matching real copy and user-facing string literals
  (innerHTML, Lit templates): tabindex precision 0.50 → 0.78, prescriptive
  0.50 → 0.71.

### Changed

- CI hard-gates the semantic held-out (`measure-semantic --min-precision 1.0
  --min-recall 0.4`); `measure-detectors` stays report-only because its
  FP/FN-ceiling corpora are a growing characterization set. Fixed a bug where
  `measure-detectors` scored the language/auth corpora as ~30 spurious false
  negatives.

### Notes

- The remaining false positives and negatives need a real parser or page
  semantics, and are deliberately left so the detectors stay dependency-free:
  whether a string literal is user-facing (innerHTML copy vs a debug/test string),
  aria-hidden across a DOM tree, CSS auto-fill reflow, and obfuscated or
  non-English source-level auth barriers.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-25

Ships the **Pattern Library v1.0** (detectors become shared, contributable data)
and folds in the detector, PDF, language, authentication, and audit-integrity
work committed on the branch since v2.1.0.

### Added

- **Declarative pattern library for the advisor detectors.** The web and PDF
  detectors run by the PostToolUse hook (`scripts/a11y-advisor-hook.mjs`) and the
  codex advisor (`adapters/codex/scripts/advisor.mjs`) are no longer hardcoded in
  each script. They are declarative records in `core/patterns/` (`web.json`,
  `pdf.json`), validated against `wcag-catalog.json` and executed by one shared
  interpreter, `core/scripts/pattern-runtime.mjs`. Both surfaces import the same
  runtime and load the same records, so they can no longer drift; the two copies
  had already diverged in four guards and two detectors before this change. 13
  records (9 web + 4 PDF) reproduce every prior detector.
- **`tools/validate-patterns.mjs`** with five gates on every record: schema, regex
  compilation, namespaced-unique id, WCAG-catalog cross-check, and a claim + leak
  lint (no over-claims, REVIEW-band messages must hedge, and `fix.example` may
  contain only synthetic identifiers so a contributed record cannot leak client
  code).
- **Characterization baseline** `test/detector-baseline.test.mjs` locking every
  web + PDF detector's fire/silent behaviour across both runtimes; the prior hook
  test had covered none of the web detectors. Plus `test/pattern-runtime.test.mjs`
  and `test/patterns-schema.test.mjs`.
- **Deterministic detector measurement harness** (`tools/measure-detectors.mjs`)
  over a labelled corpus (`corpus/*.cases.json`), reporting per-detector
  precision/recall (TP/FP/FN). Ships a calibration seed set plus a **held-out set
  (41 real-world cases)** for the four known regex-ceiling modes
  (prescriptive-input-copy, positive-tabindex, fixed-minmax-reflow,
  aria-hidden-on-focusable); held-out P/R 0.56/0.58 records the ceiling as a
  regression baseline. The held-out collection also surfaced two
  previously-undocumented misfires: aria-hidden flags the canonical `tabindex="-1"`
  remediation, and fixed-minmax flags auto-fill RAM grids.
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `node --test`, build
  `--check` parity, and the detector measurement (report-only).
- **WCAG 3.1.1 declared-vs-content language mismatch** detection in `static-audit`
  (flags an `<html lang>` that disagrees with the page's actual language), wired
  into Tier-2 so it also covers SPA/CSR pages.
- **WCAG 3.3.8 authentication barriers** (source-level): JS-set passwords,
  clipboard blocks on auth fields, and hCaptcha-style cognitive function tests.
- **PDF accessibility probe** in `static-audit` (WCAG 1.3.1 / 2.4.2 / 3.1.1 /
  4.1.x) and a **`pdf-triage` batch CLI** for auditing a site's PDFs; the codex
  advisor gains PDF-generation parity with the CC hook.
- **`quality-detect`** heuristic content-quality red-flags (generic alt text, bare
  link text).
- **WCAG 3.1.2 Language of Parts** (unmarked foreign passages) — *experimental*:
  the static heuristic over-flags on real multilingual pages and is not relied
  upon for scoring (see Notes).
- **Keyboard `focus-flow` + multi-state auditing** — the analyzer ships, but live
  capture is not reliable on real pages, so keyboard review stays manual (see
  Notes).

### Changed

- **The two detector runtimes were reconciled before externalisation** (a
  deliberate, reviewed behaviour merge, locked by the baseline): the CC hook
  gained `keydown|keyup` suppression on click handlers, a `<div>/<span> onClick`
  detector, a word-boundary on `outline`, and the tighter `min(Npx, 100%)` reflow
  guard; the codex advisor gained the `:focus`-without-`:focus-visible` detector
  and per-line `aria-hidden` scanning. Detector behaviour is otherwise preserved.
- **Audit integrity** (P1/P3/P8): `static-audit.mjs` is now the sole author of
  `audit-results.json` (P1); each run stamps an `engine_fingerprint` for
  reproducibility (P3); and LLM judgement is quarantined out of the deterministic
  machine score (P8).
- **Report palette**: cool-slate scheme; fixed a muddy score-ring colour.

### Fixed

- **PDF detection**: catalog-aware secondary-marker resolution (11 false positives
  → 0).
- **auth-hcaptcha** word boundary + a PDF encryption-suppression follow-up (P5).
- **static-audit** now reads an unquoted `<html lang=…>`.
- Addressed independent codex-review findings on the 3.1.1 / 3.x detectors.

### Docs

- Published the auth-detect and pdf-detect false-positive tables.
- Added OCRmyPDF (OCR text-layer remediation) and veraPDF to the PDF tools
  reference.

### Notes

- The pattern library is **v1.0 (data-only)**: detectors become declarative and
  contribution-ready, but the contribution flow (agent drafts, human approves, PR;
  CI schema-validation; local memory) is deferred to v1.1, and cross-person
  aggregation to v2. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).
- **Precision posture (held-out validated).** The language (3.1.1) and
  authentication (3.3.8) detectors now have a held-out validation set
  (`corpus/holdout-{lang,auth}.cases.json`, 36 realistic cases, scored by
  `tools/measure-semantic.mjs`). Scoped results:
  - **3.1.1** precision 1.00 / recall 0.50 — no false flags (holds even on CJK
    pages that are ~55% Latin); reliably catches CJK-vs-Latin and cross-CJK-script
    (zh/ja/ko) mismatches and country-code-as-language errors, but is
    **structurally blind to Latin-language-vs-Latin-language** mismatches (it
    counts scripts, so an en-declared French / German / Spanish / Vietnamese page
    reads as "Latin" and passes). The recall ceiling is the script method itself,
    not a defect.
  - **3.3.8** precision 0.88 / recall 0.54 — catches inline markup/JS barriers
    (paste-blocked password, text CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA v2 / hCaptcha, inline
    clipboard block); the heuristic source scan misses obfuscated / aliased /
    non-English-prompt / form-level cases, and it scans HTML comments (so captcha
    markup quoted in a comment can false-positive).
  - **3.1.2** stays experimental and **gated off** in static-audit (0 TP / 2 FP on
    real pages); keyboard `focus-flow` runtime capture is not reliable, so keyboard
    review stays manual. Neither carries an external precision claim.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Lighthouse performance signal in `beacon:inspect`.** Inspect now runs
  Lighthouse for the three categories axe-core does not cover — performance,
  best-practices, and SEO — and surfaces them in a new **Performance** tab in
  the HTML report. The Lighthouse run executes in parallel with the Tier 2
  axe-core audit (performance needs a cold load; axe needs the warm, rendered
  DOM), so the two never share a page load and total wall-clock collapses to the
  slower of the two.
- **Cross-cutting root causes.** `scripts/lighthouse-extract.mjs` derives signals
  where a single root cause spans multiple dimensions — e.g. an oversized DOM
  that at once slows style & layout (performance), burdens screen-reader
  traversal (accessibility), and hampers structure extraction for AI crawlers
  (AEO). This is the insight no single-purpose tool surfaces on its own.
- **`scripts/lighthouse-extract.mjs`** — normalizes a raw Lighthouse report into
  a compact `lighthouse` object (category scores, Core Web Vitals, main-thread
  breakdown, DOM stats, opportunities, best-practices/SEO issues). Handles the
  Lighthouse 13.x `dom-size` → `dom-size-insight` audit rename. Registered in the
  build manifest and exported for testing.
- 9 unit tests for the extractor (`test/lighthouse-extract.test.mjs`).

### Notes

- The Lighthouse signal is **supplementary** and is **not** folded into the
  Beacon accessibility score. axe-core remains the accessibility engine.
  Lighthouse scores swing run-to-run with device emulation, CPU throttle, and
  machine load, and are presented as directional, not absolute (the CLI default
  is mobile + 4x CPU throttle; `--preset=desktop` typically scores 15-25 points
  higher).
- **Backward compatible.** Audits without a `lighthouse` object render exactly as
  before — no Performance tab, no score change. The step is skipped when
  Lighthouse or Chrome is unavailable.

## [2.0.10] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Phase A core-extraction build system.** A single source of truth in `core/`
  now drives every generated output. `build.mjs` regenerates `commands/`,
  `scripts/`, `references/`, and `adapters/codex/` from `core/` via an
  `@cc`/`@codex` marker grammar (`tools/markers.mjs`), an explicit GENERATED
  manifest (`tools/manifest.mjs`), and an LCS variant-merge (`tools/lcs.mjs`).
  `build.mjs --check` fails on any stale output, guarding byte-identity.
- **Codex adapter** (`adapters/codex/`). Beacon runs as a Codex skill carrying
  the same accessibility + AEO knowledge without the Claude Code hook layer,
  deployed via `tools/deploy-codex.mjs`.
- **Deterministic Tier 1 scanner** `scripts/static-audit.mjs` — a
  zero-dependency, browser-free static audit that writes a
  `generate-report.mjs`-compatible `audit-results.json`. New detectors: link
  accessible-name, list structure, meta-viewport-zoom, frame-title, and scaled
  contrast heuristics; `aria-hidden` subtrees are skipped to cut false positives.
- **Contrast verification gate** in `beacon:inspect`: a static-only run can no
  longer report a passing contrast score — it must set
  `"requires_live_audit": true` and emit contrast as an explicit unverified item.
- **Step 2 automated scan is default-on**, closing the axe-core contrast
  detection gap (a 50-site survey found contrast violations the static scanner
  structurally cannot see on 18 of 50 sites).
- Test suite: `build-manifest`, `build-roundtrip`, `marker-parser`,
  `static-audit-detectors`.

## [2.0.9] — 2026-05-31

Baseline for this changelog. Highlights of the line that preceded the Phase A
refactor: AEO sub-score honesty disclaimer, full bilingual (zh/en) report,
Methodology & Limits tab, theme toggle, suggestion-toned vocabulary, and
HTML-escaping of user-supplied text in the report generator.
